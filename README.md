# GMBC_MGX_Scripts

This repository holds all scripts used in the data processing and analysis of the Article "Comparative metagenomics reveals host-specific functional adaptation of intestinal microbiota across hominids" [BioRxiv](link_goes_here). 

It also holds the complete data as an R object that can be used to repeat all analyses and create all figures in the [Analysis and Plots](/r_analysis_and_plots) folder.

Additionaly, all cophylogeny results can be browsed here: [Co-phylogeny browser](https://mruehlemann.shinyapps.io/great_apes_shiny_app/).
